# MyWeather Application

ReactJS Weather application that displays the current weather/5-day forecast of the queried location. Users can add locations to a dashboard to view weather data of multiple locations at once.

This application fetches weather data from the OpenWeather Current Weather and 5-day 3-hour Forecast APIs (https://openweathermap.org/api).
